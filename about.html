    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Catherine "Katie" Massman, a Computer Science Engineering student at the University of Notre Dame, with a minor in Engineering Corporate Practice and Digital Marketing. You can reach me via email at cmassman@nd.edu or connect with me on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherinemassman-nd">Catherine Massman LinkedIn</a>, or call me at 816-499-1551.</p>
    
<p>During my time at Notre Dame, I've delved into various aspects of computer science, including Fundamentals of Computing, Discrete Mathematics, Logic Design, Systems Programming, and Data Structures, maintaining a GPA of 3.57. Additionally, I had the opportunity to participate in an Engineering Study Abroad Program at the Notre Dame Global Gateway in Rome, Italy, during the summer of 2023.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I've been actively involved in various leadership roles and activities. Currently, I'm a Team Member at Deloitte Consulting's Student International Business Council, where I work on developing AI-driven solutions to enhance customer outreach. I've also served on the Communications Committee of the Student Government's Executive Cabinet, contributing to initiatives focused on student well-being. Moreover, I've been part of FUEL (First Undergraduate Experience with Leadership), collaborating with university staff to enhance student life.</p>

<p>Within the university community, I've contributed to The Shirt ND Communications Team, promoting the annual event to students and alumni. Additionally, I've chaired the Hall Promotion and Media Committee, leading efforts to design and manage social media platforms while curating student-generated content.</p>

<p>My professional experience includes roles such as Waitress/Hostess at Bella Napoli and Shift Lead at Yogurtini, where I honed my customer service skills, managed teams, and ensured operational efficiency.</p>

<p>One of my notable academic projects includes designing and developing a data visualization app using Matlab to illustrate the wage gap, as part of my Engineering Design coursework at the University of Notre Dame.</p>

<p>In terms of technical skills, I'm proficient in Python, C, C++, Matlab, Adobe Spark, and Adobe Illustrator, with experience working on Linux systems.</p>
